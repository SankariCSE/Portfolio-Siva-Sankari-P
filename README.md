## About the Project

This is a personal portfolio website created using HTML and Tailwind CSS. It includes an introduction, skills, education, internship experience, and project highlights .The site is fully responsive and works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## My Experience

Building this project helped me understand how to create responsive layouts using Tailwind CSS. I learned to design clean and organized sections, manage utility classes efficiently, and build a full web page using only HTML and Tailwind. It was a valuable learning experience that improved my confidence in frontend design and development.
